<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>
  My objective for this project was to develop a visual UI concept for the operatives/team system in Watch Dogs: Legion.</br> 
  The reason behind this initiative stemmed from my belief that the current UI failed to encapsulate the true aesthetic</br> 
  essence of the Watch Dogs series. I aimed to craft something more engaging and representative of the hacker group, DedSec.</br> 
  For inspiration, my focus was directed towards capturing the distinct personality of DedSec and the intricate cyberpunk universe</br> 
  inhabited by these characters. This inspired me to create the screen layout with the intention of enabling players to navigate through</br> 
  it using a cursor-style selection and traditional gamepad controls. The aesthetic I strived for was deeply rooted in the cyberpunk ethos,</br> 
  characterised by its vibrant use of gloomy/neon colours, specific shape language, and the incorporation of CRT textures. I aimed to infuse</br> 
  the UI with these elements, ensuring it would resonate with the cyberpunk atmosphere while aligning with the playful spirit of DedSec.</br>
</p>

<h3>Shape language</h3>
 <p>
  The shape language for this project drew inspiration from a floppy disk. My inspiration came from its purpose, which is used for storing information,</br>  
  this served as my creative influence for the design, infusing a touch of retro-futurism into the interface. The angular corners and geometric simplicity</br>  
  of the floppy disk's form played a huge role in shaping the visual identity of the UI, offering a subtle nod to the technological</br>  
  relics of the past while seamlessly integrating them into the cyberpunk aesthetics.</br> 
 </p>

<h3>gloomy/neon</h3>
 <p>
  The colours I utilised were intended to evoke the atmosphere of a neon-soaked, dystopian future, blurring the line between the</b>
  gloomy cityscape and the vivid neon lights.</b>

<h2>Type</h2>

<ul>
  <li><h3>blender pro</h3></li>
  <p>Used for majority of the project, different weights were implemented for better type heirachy. for tittles i specifically<br/> 
    used heavy. For body text i mainly used medium which was a suitable weight for reading from a far.
  </p>
  <li><h3>Orbitron</h3></li>
  
  <p>
    Orbitron black was mainly used for numbers, specifically stats, and inventory amounts as i felt it was more impactful then blender pro 
    when displaying numbers or singular units. Was used for controller inputs as well.
